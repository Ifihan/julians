# Welcome to Julia Weekly Meetup!ðŸŽ‰

Julia is high-level, dynamic programming language with high performance. It has a lot of applications and it's quite easy to learn. \\\\
To go about this, we're bringing a weekly meetup for all things Julia, organized by a couple of friends and I. Every week, we would be talking about various aspects of Julia based on the book, [Think Julia](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/think-julia/9781492045021/) by Ben Lauwens and Allen B. Downey. It's available on [GitHub](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html) for free.  \\\\

Check out our [topics](/topics) board here. We can't wait for you to join us and explore Julia! ðŸ¤— \\\\
P.S: We're together to learn :)
